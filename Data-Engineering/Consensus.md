# Consensus

### Problem

A fundamental problem in distributed computing and multi-agent systems is to achieve overall system reliability in the presence of a number of faulty processes. This often requires processes to agree on some data value that is needed during computation.

### Examples

* whether to commit a transaction to a database
* agreeing on the identity of a leader
