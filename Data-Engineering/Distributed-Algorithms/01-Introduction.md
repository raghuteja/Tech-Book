# Introduction

There are many different kinds of distributed algorithms. Some of the attributes by which they differ include

* Interprocess communication model
* Timing model
* Failure model

The timing model we consider are

* Synchronous model
* Asynchronous model
* Partially synchronous (timing-based) model
