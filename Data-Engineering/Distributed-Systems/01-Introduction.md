# Introduction to Distributed Systems

### Distributed Systems

A set of nodes connected by the network which will appears to the user as a single coherent system

### Core problems

Agreement problem between distributed processes

* Two General or Two Army Problem (Not solvable)
* Single value consensus (Solvable in some distributed systems)


Consensus problem is the basis for building reliable distributed systems
