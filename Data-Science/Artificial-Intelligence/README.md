### Basic Terminology

#### Fully vs Partially Observable environment

| Fully Observable Environment | Partially Observable Environment |
| -- | -- |
| Fully observable environment is one in which the agent can always see the entire state of environment | Partially observable environment is one in which the agent can never see the entire state of environment |
| In case of fully observable environments all relevant portions of the environment are observable | In case of partially observable environments not all relevant portions of the environment are observable|
| Fully observable environment not need memory to make an optimal decision | Partially observable environment need memory to make an optimal decision |
| Ex: Checker Game, Chess | Ex: Card games where it requires previous state info |
