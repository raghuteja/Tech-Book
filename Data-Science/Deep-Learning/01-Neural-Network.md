# Neural Network

#### Small Neural Network

**House Price prediction**: Using linear regression we can plot a straight line, As the house prices cannot be negative

The above house prices function can be treated as very simple neural network

The above function RELU(Rectified Linear Unit) is used very frequently in neural networks


#### Large Neural Network

A larger neural network can be formed by taking many of the single neurons and stacking them together
