# Design Principles

### Open Close Principle

The Open Close Principle states that the design and writing of the code should be done in a way that new functionality should be added with minimum changes in the existing code.

Software entities like classes, modules and functions should be open for extension but closed for modifications.

### Dependency Inversion Principle
