### Collision of two commit ids

Using 160bit SHA-1 you need 1.7e23 objects to get a 1% chance of collision. That's 10 million contributions for every man woman and child on earth together in a single repository. It would seem git will reach plenty of other bottlenecks before SHA-1 becomes a problem.
