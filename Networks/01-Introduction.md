# Introduction

Fundamental design goal of internet is **Multiplexed utilization of existing interconnected networks**

**Multiplexed** : Sharing - To solve shared use of single communications channel 
Packet switching with statistical multiplexing

**Interconnected** :

### Packet Switching with statistical multiplexing

In packet switching, Packets are composed of a header and payload. Information in the header is used by networking hardware to direct the packet to its destination where the payload is extracted and used by application software.

Packet switching is contrast to Circuit switching (Phone Network), There will be a dedicated resources between you and the recipient until the phone call ends

statistical multiplexing is sharing link by time division/ frequency division. 

**Pros :** Sender will never gets busy signal
**Cons :** Variable delay, Potential for losing or drop of a packet
