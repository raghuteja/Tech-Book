# Flow Control in Networks

### Delays in Networks

1. Transmission delay
2. Propagation delay
3. Queueing delay
4. Processing delay

#### Transmission delay

Equal to $$ Data to be transferred \over Bandwidth $$

#### Propagation delay

Equal to $$ Distance \over Velocity $$

Total time taken to send a packet from source to destination is $$ Transmission delay + Propagation delay $$

#### Queueing delay

At destination once the packets are arrived they will be placed in buffer and processed one by one, So the amount of time packet sits in buffer is queueing delay

#### Processing delay

Taking packet and one by one from buffer in destination side and processing it is called processing delay

In most of the cases Queueing delay and Processing delay is considered as negligible
